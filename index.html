              Devfolio hackathon HACKBOUT conducted by NMIT, BANGALORE.

The domain of our hack which we worked on was IoT deployed into TRADITIONAL FARMING.

The main objective is not to use any 3rd party applications such as blynk,adafruit etc. Rather look for an our own customised iot server, running in local host. 

Farms are large acres, where the data obtained at one particular location would not be sufficient to make farming techniques better, rather we considered a land say 1 hector and divide it to few divisions every division will have a set of sensors deployed on the land, communicate with all the nodes with lora / zigbee / or any RF communication,  send the data to a main device that connects to cloud.

The main device makes a json format of all the data obtained from every device and  makes a http request that would make a php script run at the server, the datas are inserted to the MySQL  database.

Motors and their respective irrigation systems are controlled by buttons on the webpage and their respective actions are done.

An automation script written in python  moniters the values in the mySQL database, variations are monitored and notified with messages.

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>S3 [Shock-Secures-Shop]</b></h5>
          <p>One of our clients has given us a problem statement  which he had faced in his shop, and asked for any solution that we could come up with to solve his issue.
Without his knowledge, the shop had been opened during the night and his properties have been stolen.So we came up with an idea that can solve this issue effectively, in terms of budget and efficiency.<br>Keeping the Budget of $70.26 in mind, We built a device that is capable of detecting whether the shop has been opened or not using sensors ( IR sensor and Magnetic sensor ) and responding to the owner through Short message peer-to-peer protocol (in short SMS service through gsm) about the status of the door.
<br>Only Authorised people with smart phone with bluetooth enabled can access the shop device and through the app he can send secret key to the device and turnoff the security.Any person who tries to open the shop without owners permission (if key is not shared),
then the doors get connects to an AC voltage of 220Vrms that gets turned-on for a period of 30 milliseconds and off for a period of 60 milliseconds.
<br>When the alert alarm is triggered, the owner is notified about the activity and he can call the device number and he would be able to hear about the happenings in the shop and speak as well. The speaker is connected to a very high Amplifier circuit that gives out a very loud sound.While the device is in off mode (security is turned off), he can play songs through his phone. This is a complementary feature of our product.

          <h6 class="w3-text-black">
          <p>An IoT based project providing a solution to the problems faced in house-hold kitchens.It is a gas-stove (as name suggests), where the gas-stove can be controlled by an Android app, from anywhere on the earth.It also features, gas leaakage sensation, where the gas leakage is detected and turns off the mains and gives an alert to our smartphones via SMS or through the app. Vessels, when not placed after lighting the stove, will turn off the gas flow to nil,even when gas stove is not light up properly.Thus, <b>providing safety at kitchens is our most priority</b>
          Unutilised amount of heat obtained is used to generate electricity, using Seedback Peltium and Thomson effect, which is used to run the system.This project won the HACKATHON Technical Compitation conducted at University level.
